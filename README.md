# Time Series Analysis for Apple Closing Prices (2023)

## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for time series forecasting of Apple's closing prices for the year 2023. The dataset includes date and closing price attributes, and various time series analysis techniques have been applied, including the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, ARIMA modeling, and XGBoost forecasting.

## Dataset

The dataset was collected using QuantRocket and includes the following columns:

- **Date:** The timestamp for each data point.
- **Close:** The closing price of Apple stock on the given date.

## Analysis

### 1. Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test

The ADF test was performed to check the stationarity of the time series data. The notebook/file `adf_test.ipynb` contains the implementation and results of the ADF test.

### 2. ARIMA Modeling

The ARIMA model was employed for time series forecasting. The notebook/file `arima_model.ipynb` provides the code and insights into the ARIMA modeling process.

### 3. XGBoost Forecasting

XGBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm, was used for time series forecasting. The notebook/file `xgboost_forecasting.ipynb` demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of the XGBoost model.
